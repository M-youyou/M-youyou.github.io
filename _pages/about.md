I am an Associate Researcher and Master's Supervisor at IResearch Center for Ubiquitous Computing Systems (CUbiCS), Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

My interest areas include EEG/EMG physiological signal analysis, multi-modality learning, and gesture/human activity recognition.

I also got my PhD degree at ICT, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.ict.cas.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496596.html">Professor Yiqiang Chen</a>.
